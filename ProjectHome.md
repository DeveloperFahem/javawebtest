In this Google Code Hosting Project you find the source code for my Google AppEngine Java Application which is written to demo some Single Sign On concepts for social Web Apps.

Right now this only allows application read authentication with Flickr.

The repository contains various libraries provided by the Google AppEngine wizard, which may have a different license.
